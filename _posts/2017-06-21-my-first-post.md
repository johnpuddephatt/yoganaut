title: It’s nearly time for our AGM!
---
We look forward to welcoming members to our first AGM on 21 June 2017 at Heart in Headingley.

All information relating to the AGM is available on our Eventbrite page.  You don’t need to sign up via Eventbrite – or bring along your order confirmation – in order to attend.  If you are a member of Leeds Community Homes and would like to attend our AGM, please just turn up – from 645pm for a 7pm start.

In order to keep costs low, we will be printing limited numbers of documents (accounts etc) for the AGM.  There will be some copies on tables to share, but if you would like to refer to documents during the meeting please print them off beforehand.
