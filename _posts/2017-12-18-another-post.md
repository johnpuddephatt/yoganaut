Some great news as we being to wind down for Christmas - we can confirm that Power To Change have agreed to fund us during 2018 to establish a Community-Led Housing Hub - so that we can support more people to create People Powered Homes in Leeds!

We're thrilled that Power To Change have agreed to support us in this way - Leeds and Bristol are the two cities they've initially agreed to support. And of course it comes on the back of their Â£100,000 investment in us, alongside the hundreds of you who backed our People Powered Homes plans.

Rest assured, after a few days off over Christmas and New Year we'll be straight back at it and will do all we can to make 2018 a year full of people power!
