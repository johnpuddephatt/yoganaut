I’m a qualified yoga teacher based in Leeds.

After practicing yoga for over 10 years, in 2016 I trained at The Wise Living Yoga Academy — affiliated with the world's oldest yoga institution in Santa Cruz, Mumbai.

I teach Hatha, Vinyasa and Restorative yoga. I’m particularly interested in how yoga can be used as a force for good in the world and how it can benefit everyone regardless of ability, fitness or age.
